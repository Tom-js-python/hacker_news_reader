# Hacker News Scraper and Reader
This application scrapes the first pages (number of pages supplied by the user) of the Hacker News website, and then returns the top links (number of links supplied by the user) based on how many points they received to a table on the front-end. 
The back-end is built with a REST API using Flask in Python and the Beautiful Soup scraping library. The front end is built with Vue.js.
