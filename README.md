# Hacker News Scraper and Reader
This application scrapes the first n pages (supplied by the user) of the Hacker News website, and then returns the top pages (number of pages supplied by the user) to a table on the front-end. 
The back-end is built with a REST API using Flask in Python and the Beautiful Soup scraping library. The front end is built with React
