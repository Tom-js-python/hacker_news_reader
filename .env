# The primary location of this file is in the root directory. Please make the changes to it
# there. The dev:frontend and build scripts in the root package.json file copy the .env file
# from the root directory overtop of the one in the /frontend directory. This is done since
# Python reads the environment variables from the root directory, whereas vite in the frontend
# must have them in its directory
